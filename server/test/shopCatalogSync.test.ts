// server/src/shopCatalog.ts is a HAND-MAINTAINED mirror of the `mapSize` and `climate`
// sections of public/assets/upgrades.json, and it is what the server charges.
//
// The last of the hand-typed catalogs to get a guard (the rest either derive from their
// asset at module load — rosterCatalog, zombieCropCatalog, questCatalog — or were already
// covered: CROPS by farm.test.ts, OBJECTS by objectCatalogSync, BOOSTS by boostCatalogSync).
//
// Two distinct failures live here. A wrong PRICE is the obvious one. The quieter one is a
// missing KEY: `climateCost` returning undefined makes the server answer `bad_climate` for
// a skin the Market is still offering, so the card is visible, costed, and unbuyable — and
// nothing logs it as a mismatch because from the server's side it is a well-formed refusal.
