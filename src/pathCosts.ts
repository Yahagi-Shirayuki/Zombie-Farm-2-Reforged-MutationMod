// What placed terrain costs a walker, in tiles-worth-of-effort per tile entered.
//
// The pathfinder used to be a pure yes/no: a placed object blocked the tile, bare
// ground did not, and everything else was identical. That made a hedge an absolute
// wall (a zombie fenced in by one could only ever be teleported out) and it made a
// road no more attractive to walk on than the grass beside it — in fact roads were
// BLOCKING, because they are placed objects like any other.
//
// So terrain now has a price instead. Nothing here is impassable except genuinely
// solid objects (a barn, a tree, a Mausoleum); a hedge is merely so ruinously
// expensive that a route only crosses one when there is no other way round at all,
// which is the behaviour a fence is supposed to have without the "permanently
// stuck" failure mode. The ordering between the barrier numbers is the design:
//
//   path 0.75  <  ground/open gate 1  <  pond 3  <<  closed gate 9000  <  hedge 10000
//
// A closed gate undercutting the fence run it sits in is what makes a penned-in
// walker leave through the DOOR rather than straight through the hedge.
