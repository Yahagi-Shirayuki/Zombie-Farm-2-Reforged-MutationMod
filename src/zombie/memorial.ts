// The graveyard: zombies that died in an invasion and were not revived.
//
// Losses are permanent (GROUND TRUTH — raids cull the fallen), and the one chance
// to undo one is the brain-priced revival offer shown the moment the raid settles.
// Nothing here changes that. A fallen zombie is a MEMENTO: it can be enshrined on
// a Memorial Statue and inspected, and that is the whole of what it can ever do.
// It never returns to the roster, never fights, and cannot be sold.
//
// A fallen record carries the same minimal identity a living roster unit does —
// species key, mutation mask, veterancy, inherited tint — and the card is derived
// from the catalog exactly the way `makeOwned` derives a living unit's. The two
// extra fields are the ones that stop existing with the unit: the date it died and
// the name its owner gave it (names are not part of the catalog).
