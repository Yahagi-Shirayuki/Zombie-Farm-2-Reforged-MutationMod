// The stone statue of a fallen zombie, as it stands on a Memorial Statue's plinth.
//
// It is the SAME rig the inspect-card portrait builds — same species model, same
// mutation replacements and overlays — so a memorial shows the zombie the player
// actually lost, freckle for freckle. Two things differ:
//
//   • It is carved, not alive. Nothing about it animates: no head-nod, no walk, no
//     idle blink. The rig is built once and never ticked.
//   • It is stone. A tint alone cannot do that (tinting multiplies, so a red arm
//     just becomes a darker red), so the colour is stripped with a desaturating
//     colour matrix and the result re-tinted to granite. That happens for the whole
//     rig at once, which is what keeps a carrot arm and a skull the same stone.
//
// The filter is baked with cacheAsTexture: the statue never changes, so paying for
// a filter pass on every frame of every statue would be a farm-wide frame cost for
// a picture that is identical each time.
