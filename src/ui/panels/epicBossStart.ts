// The announcement that an Epic Boss event has begun.
//
// It exists mainly for the events the player did NOT ask for. A favourite crop can lure
// its boss out of a plain harvest (epicBoss/favoriteCrops.ts), and online that roll is
// the server's — so the event arrives on a settle, some seconds after the harvest, with
// nothing on screen tying it to the crop that caused it. Without this the whole feature
// reads as "the Boss button changed colour at some point".
//
// A bought event opens it too. The same 14-day clock starts either way, and a player who
// just spent brains still wants to be told what they now own.

 *
 *  - Nothing announces before the first adoption. That one is the bootstrap, and an
 *    event that was already running when the game loaded is not news — without this,
 *    every reload during a 14-day event reopens the popup.
 *  - Only a run carrying `startedCrop` announces here. A bought event is announced by
 *    the code that bought it, which knows the purchase succeeded and does not have to
 *    infer it from a state change.
 *  - A run announces once. Settles are frequent and re-adopt the same projection.
