// Which decor is on sale right now.

// Every placeable carries at most one `theme` label (authored in
// tools/prep_placeables.py — the source data has none). A row with no label is
// `evergreen` and always sold. A labelled row is sold only while its label is on
// ACTIVE_THEMES.
//
// The allow-list is deliberately a plain array rather than a date computation.
// Whatever eventually drives it — fixed calendar windows, a server-pushed list, an
// enableDate-style field — it drives THIS array, and every call site is already
// correct. Editing it is the whole gating action.
//
// Client and server both import this, so the market and the buy command agree.
// See docs/DECOR_RESTORATION_PLAN.md (D2).
