// A damage number reports the ATTACK, not the health it removed.
//
// The floating figures used to be sampled as an HP delta in RaidScene, so both of the
// fight's damage clamps silently shrank them: a blow bigger than the target's remaining
// health read as that health, and the one-shot protection latch — which snaps a doomed
// zombie to 1 HP — read as "hp - 1". Measuring the Pirate boss that way reported ~2000
// for a swing that is authored to hit for 5000. The sim now publishes the post-mitigation
// size of every hit on `SimUnit.damageFxTaken`, ahead of both clamps, and the scene floats
// increases in THAT. These pin the difference.
//
// Mitigation still counts: `damageFxTaken` is fed after armor / damage reduction / attack
// multipliers, so a reduced hit reads reduced and a fully blocked one is never published.
