// Tim's pre-fight briefings. The point of the whole file is that a tip is the game's
// OWN warning moved earlier, so the two invariants worth guarding are that every tip
// belongs to a real invasion and that the Pirates' tip still matches the wording their
// defeat text uses — tools/prep_raids.py regenerates raids.json, and a reworded
// failureText would silently leave Tim quoting a line the game no longer says.
