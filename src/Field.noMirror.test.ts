// Objects with writing baked into their art must never be mirrored.
//
// "Rotate" is a horizontal flip, which in isometric art is exactly a quarter turn — and
// which turns the Ice Cream Stand's sign into "MAERC ECI". A player reported it. There is
// no mechanical repair (the letters would have to be re-skewed onto a plank now leaning
// the other way), so those objects do not turn at all, and the tool says why.
//
// The refusal is enforced in Field rather than at the tool, because the tool is not the
// only way a flip arrives: a restored save replays one, and so does a Move that was
// carrying a turned object. Field is the single door.
