"""
Quest-data prep for the ZF2R quest engine.

Reads the extracted 1.0 app bundle's Quests.plist (the authoritative, data-driven
quest definitions) and produces:

  public/assets/quests.json      all 105 quests, normalized to JSON (71 standard +
                                 34 Epic Boss event quests, incl. the Bully Frog
                                 records embedded in the EpicEventEnemy row)
  public/assets/ui/<sprite>.png  each quest's top-level rail icon (loose PNGs)

The quest engine (src/quest/) consumes quests.json at runtime. Every quest is kept,
including raid/social/seasonal ones whose trigger events don't have emitters yet;
those simply never advance until their system lands (dormant, not broken).

# Decor sold in several colors is ONE item for quest purposes: buying any Fence
# satisfies "Fence", because every recolor answers to its siblings' names (see
# src/quest/objectVariants.ts). The source objective text names a color anyway —
# "Buy 4 White Fences" against the requirement "Fence", "Buy 2 Red Balloons"
# against "Balloon" — which tells the player to hunt a specific card that is not
# actually required, and in the Flower Bed case is now outright wrong.
#
# So: when an objective's subject belongs to a recolor family, the color adjective
# comes out of its text. Objectives naming genuinely distinct art keep theirs — the
# Easter eggs and circus flags are separate sprites, not tints, and "Orange Tree"
# is a fruit.

# ---- Quest gates the shipped data gets wrong ---------------------------------
# A quest whose objective needs something the player cannot yet buy or plant sits

# Quests.plist, and lives in the generator (not in quests.json) so a regeneration
# cannot silently revert it, exactly like CROP_REBALANCE in reforge_economy.py.
#
# Most of these come from the crop rebalance (tools/reforge_economy.py), which
# respread the 25 regular crops over levels 1-45: every quest below asked for a
# crop that now unlocks later than the quest did. Each gate is the highest crop
# level the quest requires — no higher, so nothing is delayed further than the
# objective itself demands. src/quest/cropUnlockAlignment.test.ts is what fails if
# this table and the crop ladder ever drift apart again.

# quests that gate each event's prizes were authored against the 40-rung ladder, so a
# "Defeat Loco Locust Level 40" objective would now be unreachable and every milestone
# above 20 would sit off the end of the ladder.
